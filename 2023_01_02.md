### Full node integration hotfix

The full node integration of Wasabi clients - latest release - are broken from 1st of January. Minor part of the users are effected by this, however we did not get any support requests so far. [PR](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/9872)

### Known Bots enabled on CloudFlare
A rule was added to our CloudFlare service. From this point bots from the biggest search engines will be never rejected by wasabiwallet.io and co. List of the bots is [here](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots). Also [permission rule](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/9870) was fixed, this will further imporve the UX for the bots on our website.
